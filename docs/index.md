# Welcome To Learn Engine Dev

## About

Welcome to a tutorial series for creating a simple game engine from scratch!  Making a game engine is no easy task and each system we create could have multiple tutorials of its own.  But fear not, we will walk through building an engine each system at a time.  This tutorial series currently supports windows and linux, but may expand to other platforms in the future.

## Prerequisites

Programming and technical skills of all levels are welcome, but to get the most out of this tutorial series you should have the following:

* A basic understanding of C++.  This includes compiling and writing code.
* Proficiency with writing code in Python.
* A high level understanding of OpenGL.

## Structure

Each chapter of this tutorial series is broken up into sections which can be navigated to via the menu on the left.  Each chapter and section has source code attributed to it which can be found within the [github repo](https://github.com/Chukobyte/learn-engine-dev).

## Tech Stack

The engine will be built with the following technologies:

* **C++ 14** - Core engine
* **OpenGL 3.3** - Graphics API
* **SDL2** - Windowing and input
* **SDL2_mixer** - Audio
* **Python 3.7** - Scripting language for game logic
* **AStyle** - Used for formatting C++ code
