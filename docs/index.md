# Welcome To Learn Engine Dev

## About

Welcome to a tutorial series for creating a simple game engine from scratch!  Making a game engine is no easy task and each system we create could have multiple tutorials of its own.  But fear not, we will walk through building an engine each system at a time.  This tutorial series currently supports windows and linux, but may expand to other platforms in the future.

## Prerequisites

Programming skills of all levels are welcome, but to get the most out of this tutorial series you should have the following traits:

* Comfortable writing code in C++
* Proficient with Python
* High Level Understanding of OpenGL

## Structure

Each section of this tutorial series is broken up into chapters which can be found on the menu to the left.  Each chapter has source code attributed to it which can be found within the [github repo](https://github.com/Chukobyte/learn-engine-dev).

## Tech Stack

The tech stack will consist of the following:

* C++ 14
* OpenGL 3.3
* SDL2
* SDL2_mixer (audio)
